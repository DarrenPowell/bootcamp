<p style = "margin: 100px;"> I studied at Tshwane University of Technology and recieved a BTech degree in Music. I have been working as a guitarist for almost for 10 years before I switched to a new profession - Developer. I love it. If only I had done it sooner.

I am highly-motivated, result oriented, self-driven, hard-working, fast learner, smart and eager to be a part of the team, learn new technologies, become a valuable employee of the company and bring it success.

I am well-organized with an ability to prioritize tasks and capability to work, develop and grow in the company. I have good communications skills and love being involved and working with people!

I self studied html, css and javascript, and I am currently studying through code college to further my learning in developement. I am doing in depth java studies and learning the ways of Object Oriented Programming. I am also learning frameworks such as Spring and JHipster. I am also learning Oracle SQL, MySql as well as Angular.
I am working toward being a complete package that can contribute to a company.
